/*For the lab assignment, write a C program that prints a prompt requesting an integer. Read this integer
into a variable. Prompt the user to enter a second integer. Read this integer into another variable.
• Print the values of both variables that were entered by the user.
• Print the value of the first variable times the second variable.
• Print the value of the second variable divided by the first variable.
• Print the value of the first variable plus 5, quantity times the second variable (e.g.: Imagine you
named the first variable X and the second variable Y. If X is 3 and Y is 2 then X plus 5 quantity
times Y is 16 because X plus 5 is 8 and 8 times 2 is 16).
• Print the values of both original variables again to show that they did not change.*/
